# AzureIotTemplate
Azure Iot iOS template to integrate C SDK

### 1. Import OpenSSL library and cURL library to iOS project

You can easily find their source code on github but it's not friendly to generate libraries for iOS. After a million times try, finally i found workable [pod library](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL) for OpenSSL and [framework](https://github.com/Cogosense/iOSCurlFramework/releases) for cURL, just add the pod for OpenSSL and import the framework for cURL in the iOS project.

> It's still recommended to build the libraries from source code if it is comfortable for you.

Then add `-lz` to **Other Linker Flags** in your project build settings, this will against the built-in zlib.


### 2. Build C SDK for iOS

1. Clone C SDK
- `git clone git@github.com:Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git`.

2. Generate an XCode Project, set to use openssl
-    cd C SDK root directory
-   `mkdir cmake`
-   `cd cmake`
-   `cmake -G Xcode -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl -Duse_openssl:bool=ON ..`

> DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR is the path of your openssl library in step 1

3. Config build settings
-   Open `azure_iot_sdks.xcodeproj` in cmake folder
-   Edit **Build Settings** for all library targets (`aziotsharedutil`, `iothub_client` ...)
    -  Change **Base SDK** from `macos` to `ios`
    -  Add architectures whatever you need
-   Edit **Search Paths** for target `aziotsharedutil` to link `OpenSSL` library and `cURL` library that  in step 1
    -  If you use static library, add path for header file to **Header Search Paths** and add path for `.a` library to **Library Search Paths**
    -  If you use framework, just add the path to **Framework Search Paths**

```
For example, this is you openssl static library, you need to add `../openssl/include` to  **Header Search Paths** and add `../openssl/lib` to **Library Search Paths**
openssl
├── include
│   └── openssl
│       ├── aes.h
│       ├── ... (header files)
└── lib
    ├── libcrypto.a
    └── libssl.a
```

4. Build C SDK
-   If all the configuration are correct, you should be able to build all the libraries with iOS device or iOS simulator in `azure_iot_sdks.xcodeproj`

### 3. Import C SDK to iOS project
- After step 2, you will get all C SDK libraries you need in /cmake folder in your C SDK project. However,  the headers and static libraries are scattered in different paths, you have to link them to your iOS project.
- You can refer to C SDK sample project to check all the header search path, for example, open `azure_iot_sdks.xcodeproj`, go to **Build Settings** > **Search Paths** of any target for sample (like iothub_II_Client_x509_sample), you can see the search path for each library.

  
You can refer to  https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/issues/1260 if you there is a problem.
